Uses [NativeUI](https://github.com/Guad/NativeUI/releases) to create a visually engaging and interactive menu named "Vehicle Spawner," showcasing various vehicles that players can spawn directly in the game.

**Vehicle Selection:**

Players can choose from a list of vehicles. Which can be changed in the menu.lua

This selection is facilitated through a list item within the menu, allowing for easy scrolling and selection.
Dynamic Vehicle Spawning: Upon selection, the script handles the game mechanics to spawn the chosen vehicle near the player's current location. This includes loading the vehicle model dynamically, ensuring it is properly placed on the ground, and handling any necessary game physics.

**Menu Visibility Management:** 

The script toggles the visibility of the menu with the F5 key, providing a quick and easy way to access the vehicle spawning options. Additionally, camera controls are temporarily disabled when the menu is visible to prevent unintended camera movements, enhancing the user interface interaction.

**Notifications:**

Feedback is provided through in-game notifications, informing the player of the current actions being taken, such as which vehicle is successfully spawned. This helps in keeping the player informed about the process and results.
